***This python program will convert raw copied text from the childsmath website into a
MATLAB-formatted matrix for ease of transfer from website to code.***

How to use:
1) Copy matrix from childsmath website (might work with other websites). Only include the matrix entries into your copy/paste, no equal sign or other letters.
2) Paste the matrix into the "InputMatrices" text file.
3) Run the python program. No window will open. This is normal.
4) Check the "OutputMatrices" text file for your formatted matrix. If OutputMatrices.txt was open while you ran the program, it will not get updated in real time -- you have to close and re-open it.

DISCLAIMER: Be sure to double check your output matrix code in case there's a bug or something.
